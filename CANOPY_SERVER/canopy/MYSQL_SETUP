To install MySQL on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

    Update the package index by running the following command:

    

sudo apt update

Install the MySQL server package by running this command:

sudo apt install mysql-server

During the installation process, you'll be prompted to set a password for the MySQL root user. Choose a strong password and remember it as you'll need it later.

Once the installation is complete, you can start the MySQL service by running:



sudo systemctl start mysql


sudo mysql

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new_password';

CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE employees (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR(50),age INT,email VARCHAR(100));
